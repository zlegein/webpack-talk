        -Looking around, found webpack/angular/es6 workflow,
        -created by Jesus Rodriquez, as a starter for projects.
        -there are a few others out there that i stumbled upon
        -what I like about this one is, it is well documented
        -so this is the start of story time.
        -this is the unstructured part of the talk and what i would like to do is demo the app, show the HMR goodness
        -then dive into the configs and go through some more advanced settings and have a look at the structure.
        -reasons why i picked this setup
        -currently working on angular project
        -wanted to write some es6 code
