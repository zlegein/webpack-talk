    <h5>Hot Module Replacement Plugin</h5>
    <img class="fragment" src="/images/HMR.svg" style="background-color:white;">
    <aside class="notes">
    - labeled as experimental</br>
    - is a feature to inject updated modules into the active runtime without a page reload (think of it as live reload at the module level)</br>
    - what does that look like, especially when dealing with complex dependency graphs</br>
    - when in 'hot' mode changes will try to be updated with HMR before trying to reload the whole page</br>
    - you can use this in production, but still labeled as experimental</br>
