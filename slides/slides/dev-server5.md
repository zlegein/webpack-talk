    <aside class="notes">
    - is a feature to inject updated modules into the active runtime (think of it as live reload at the module level)</br>
    - lots of stuff going on behind the scenes here, we will go over a few items</br>
    - when in 'hot' mode changes will try to be updated with HMR before trying to reload the whole page</br>
    - you can use this in production, but still labeled as experimental</br>
