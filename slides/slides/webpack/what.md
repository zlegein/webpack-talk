        what was the motivation for tobias to write webpack?
        it collects a variety of web assets and packs them into a bundle that can be served to the client. Sounds simple,
        grunt, and gulp do this but as we all know things get messy quickly.
        Webpack is an elaborate module bundler that hides a lot of power behind configuration
        Heavily used in the react.js ecosystem, facebook open source community would love to see FB hire him full time.
